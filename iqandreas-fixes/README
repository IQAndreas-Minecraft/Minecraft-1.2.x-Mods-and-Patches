    IQAndreas Fixes v1.2.5-01
    For MineCraft 1.2.5 (will not work with older or newer versions)

A collection if my favorite fixes to MineCraft.

* Using a lava bucket in a furnace does not consume the bucket.
* Cauldrons with water in them work as magical 1x1 infinite water sources.
* Right-clicking a cauldron with a bucket of water will empty the bucket.
* Insta-break items (such as torches and redstone) don't damage tools.
* Endermen drop the blocks they are holding (such as grass and melons) when killed. This is a great way to get grass blocks without the Silk Touch enchantment.
* Pumpkins don't require a solid block beneath them when placed and can therefore be placed on ceilings and walls.

* The following recepies have become shapeless:
    - Flint and steel
    - Jack-o-lanterns
    - Sticky pistons
    - Storage minecarts
    - Powered minecarts

* You can create double half-slab blocks in your inventory (which you can build with without needing to place two half-slab blocks)
    - Double smooth stone blocks are made with two smoothstone slabs
    - Fireproof double wood blocks are made with two wood slabs

* You can convert some double slabs back into full blocks
    - Two cobblestone slabs become one cobblestone block
    - Two stone brick slabs become one stone brick block
    - Two brick slabs become one brick block


    THIS IS A PATCH, NOT A MOD

 - It will not affect your world save
    No new items or blocks will be added to your maps. This means the mod can be uninstalled, reinstalled, or MineCraft upgraded (causing the patch to automatically uninstall) without any issues.
    
 - It is not meant to be compatible with other mods (including ModLoader or other mod APIs)
    If you want mod compatability, send me all the information about the mod you want this patch to be compatible with. If able, I will contact the mod developer and if they are willing, create a compatible version.
    
 - It does not require any mod APIs
    This patch modifies base classes in the MineCraft source code. No mod APIs are required to use it, nor can it be modified to use a mod API rather than modifying base classes (hooks just won't cut it!).
