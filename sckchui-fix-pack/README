    The Sckchui Fix Patch Pack v1.2.5-01
    For MineCraft 1.2.5 (will not work with older or newer versions)

Slime spawning acts just like other mobs:
 - Requires light level 7 or less to spawn
 - Is now just as likely to spawn as other mobs (used to be 1/10 as likely)
 - Still only spawns below level 40

Crafting 4 sand in the crafting table gives 4 sandstone (instead of 1)

Also includes the following patches:
 - No More Void Fog! (http://iqandreas.github.com/minecraft/no-more-void-fog/)
 - No More Ender Griefing! (http://iqandreas.github.com/minecraft/no-more-ender-griefing/)
 - No More Silverfish Griefing! (http://iqandreas.github.com/minecraft/no-more-silverfish-griefing/)


    THIS IS A PATCH, NOT A MOD

 - It will not affect your world save
    No new items or blocks will be added to your maps. This means the mod can be uninstalled, reinstalled, or MineCraft upgraded (causing the patch to automatically uninstall) without any issues.
    
 - It is not meant to be compatible with other mods (including ModLoader or other mod APIs)
    If you want mod compatability, send me all the information about the mod you want this patch to be compatible with. If able, I will contact the mod developer and if they are willing, create a compatible version.
    
 - It does not require any mod APIs
    This patch modifies base classes in the MineCraft source code. No mod APIs are required to use it, nor can it be modified to use a mod API rather than modifying base classes (hooks just won't cut it!).
