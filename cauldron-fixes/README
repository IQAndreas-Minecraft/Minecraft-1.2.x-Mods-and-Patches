    Cauldron Fixes v1.2.5-01
    For MineCraft 1.2.5 (will not work with older or newer versions)

Cauldrons now work as magical 1x1 infinite water source blocks.

Fill an empty cauldron with water from a bucket. Once it is filled:
* You can fill empty buckets with water from the cauldron
* You can fill empty bottles with water from the cauldron
* You can empty buckets of water into the cauldron, giving you an empty bucket

The cauldron will never run out of water.


    THIS IS A PATCH, NOT A MOD

 - It will not affect your world save
    No new items or blocks will be added to your maps. This means the mod can be uninstalled, reinstalled, or MineCraft upgraded (causing the patch to automatically uninstall) without any issues.
    
 - It is not meant to be compatible with other mods (including ModLoader or other mod APIs)
    If you want mod compatability, send me all the information about the mod you want this patch to be compatible with. If able, I will contact the mod developer and if they are willing, create a compatible version.
    
 - It does not require any mod APIs
    This patch modifies base classes in the MineCraft source code. No mod APIs are required to use it, nor can it be modified to use a mod API rather than modifying base classes (hooks just won't cut it!).

----------------------------------------------------------------

This mod does not work with with the following mods. If you need mod compatability, contact me for a compatible version.
 - No More Ender Griefing! Patch (http://iqandreas.github.com/minecraft/no-more-ender-griefing/)
