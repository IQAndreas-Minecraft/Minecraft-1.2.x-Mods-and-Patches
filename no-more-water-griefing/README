    No More Water Griefing! Patch v1.2.5-01
    For MineCraft 1.2.5 (will not work with older or newer versions)

Patch that prevents your redstone circuits from being griefed by flowing water.

Water no longer destroys:
 * Torches
 * Rails
 * Redstone torches
 * Redstone dust
 * Redstone repeaters
 * Buttons
 * Levers


NOTE: Like signs, all the above items will stop water flow. However, don't rely on this mechanic in redstone designs; if for any reason the patch uninstalls (such as in a MineCraft update or manual uninstall of the patch) the water may receive a block update and destroy the redstone or torches holding it back. This patch is simply to prevent accidentally destroying your circuits while creating redstone machines.


    THIS IS A PATCH, NOT A MOD

 - It will not affect your world save
    No new items or blocks will be added to your maps. This means the mod can be uninstalled, reinstalled, or MineCraft upgraded (causing the patch to automatically uninstall) without any issues.
    
 - It is not meant to be compatible with other mods (including ModLoader or other mod APIs)
    If you want mod compatability, send me all the information about the mod you want this patch to be compatible with. If able, I will contact the mod developer and if they are willing, create a compatible version.
    
 - It does not require any mod APIs
    This patch modifies base classes in the MineCraft source code. No mod APIs are required to use it, nor can it be modified to use a mod API rather than modifying base classes (hooks just won't cut it!).
